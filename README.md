# Multi-Processing and Multi-Threading Word Frequency Analyzer

## Overview

This project analyzes the **top 10 most frequent words** in a large dataset (`enwik8`) using three different approaches:

- **NaÃ¯ve Approach** (no parallelism)
- **Multiprocessing Approach** (using multiple processes)
- **Multithreading Approach** (using multiple threads)

It measures and compares execution times for each approach to evaluate the benefits of parallelism on multi-core systems.

## Problem Statement

Find the **top 10 most frequent words** in the `enwik8` dataset:  
ðŸ“„ Dataset: [enwik8 (HuggingFace)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LTCB/enwik8)

Compare the three approaches by measuring execution time for:

- 2, 4, 6, 8 processes/threads.
- Analyze results using **Amdahl's Law**.
- Discuss performance differences and draw conclusions.

## Requirements

- **GCC** Compiler
- **Linux OS** (Virtual Machine or Native)
- **C Language**
- Shared memory APIs (`shm_open`, `mmap`) for multiprocessing
- POSIX threads (`pthread`) for multithreading

## Results Summary

| Approach | Execution Time |
|:---------|:---------------|
| NaÃ¯ve | 45 minutes |
| Multiprocessing (2 processes) | 27 minutes |
| Multiprocessing (4 processes) | 16.19 minutes |
| Multiprocessing (6 processes) | 15.1 minutes |
| Multiprocessing (8 processes) | 12.2 minutes |
| Multithreading (2 threads) | 28 seconds |
| Multithreading (4 threads) | 16.7 seconds |
| Multithreading (6 threads) | 16.3 seconds |
| Multithreading (8 threads) | 15.2 seconds |

âœ… **Multithreading** achieved the best performance.
